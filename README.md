# Pro-AdBlock

Advertising displayed on webpages can be a security risk. Currently, the advertising consists of embedded third party content. These contents are not under the website's owner editorial control and add a repeatedly criminally exploited attack vector to the website. An adblocker protects a user's surfing. This plugin supports the usage of advertisement blockers and shows a warning message to users that have no adblocker enabled.
